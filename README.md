## Why This Project

This project was created as a **backend showcase** to demonstrate my ability to design and implement RESTful APIs using **Laravel 12**.
It highlights clean architecture, structured routing, database design, and controller logic following Laravel best practices.
The goal is to provide a solid and maintainable backend that cleanly integrates with a modern frontend built in **React + TypeScript**, showcasing a complete full-stack workflow.

Key focuses:

-   RESTful API design principles
-   Database migrations, models, and relationships
-   Clear and consistent route definitions
-   Scalable structure ready for authentication and advanced features
-   Easy integration with external clients (frontend apps or Postman)

---

## Features

-   Built with Laravel
-   RESTful API with CRUD operations
-   MySQL (or SQLite) database integration
-   Example frontend integration

---

## Tech Stack
